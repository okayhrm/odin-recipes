    <h1>Goat Cheese-Stuffed Lamb Burgers</h1>
    <img src="/home/hrm/odin-recipes/Images/lambburger.webp" width="450" height="300"></img>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love making these flavorful lamb burgers stuffed with creamy, delicious goat cheese. I use basil and oregano in mine, but feel free to use your favorite herbs and spices as this recipe is very forgiving. Serve on hamburger buns or pita bread with tzatziki sauce or on their own with a Greek salad.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground lamb</li>
        <li>4 ounces soft goat cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>4 Â½ teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently knead together onion, lamb, egg, bread crumbs, garlic, salt, and pepper. Divide mixture into six parts and roll into balls, then cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Mix together goat cheese, extra-virgin olive oil, basil, and oregano until well combined; cover and chill for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li>Working with one portion of meat at a time, make an indentation in the center of the ball with your thumb. Fill the indentation with a heaping tablespoon of goat cheese mixture. Gently pull and form the meat patty around the cheese filling, making a burger-shaped patty. Repeat with each ball of lamb mixture.</li>
        <li>Grill patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium or 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) for well done.</li>
    </ol>
